Types of subordinate clauses
* adverbial clauses
    * provide the situational context for the event or state described in a main clause
* complement clauses
    * arguments of (and therefore syntactically essential to) the clause in which they are embedded
    * possible to replace with pronouns
* relative clauses
    * behave like adjectives, usually modifiers of a noun phrase

Adverbial Clauses
* hard to classify since they have a breadth of meanings

Complement Clause
* a clause that is an argument of a predicate, typically as a subject or direct object
* two main ways to signal dependency:
    * complementiser (subordination particle)
    * use of non-finite verb forms

Relative Clauses
* also called adjective clauses
* typically found as modifiers of a noun

* Preposition stranding
    * in english, if relativisation of a noun occurs, the preposition associated with it may appear in its conventional position within the adjective clause, or before the relative pronoun (if the latter, this is called pipe-piping)

inflection = adding of grammatical information to a word, e.g. plural marking in english “-s"
derivation = creating new lexeme (new concepts) from existing lexemes
productivity: inflectional affixes have relatively few exceptions (they tend to be very productive), while derivational affixes typically apply to a restricted set of bases

Privacy = "the right to control who knows certain aspects about you, your communications, and your activities”

Privacy Law = the protection of an individual’s personal information 

Computers can track almost all our data! 

Data ownership = data can be sold/passed from organisation to organisation, meaning your data could go all over the place -> and its almost impossible to retract data once its gone out.

Anonymity: without a name or nameless
Pseudonymity: establish a long-term relationship with another entity, without disclosing identity known to others (eg an internet handle)
identity = information that uniquely designates a single person (so just name isn’t often good enough!)

Authentication = verification of this identity

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.

Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, describes nature at ordinary (macroscopic) scale. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality); and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be measured (uncertainty principle).

Quantum mechanics gradually arose from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and from the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. Early quantum theory was profoundly re-conceived in the mid-1920s by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical function, the wave function, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.

Important applications of quantum theory[5] include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy. Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA
