Types of subordinate clauses
* adverbial clauses
    * provide the situational context for the event or state described in a main clause
* complement clauses
    * arguments of (and therefore syntactically essential to) the clause in which they are embedded
    * possible to replace with pronouns
    * a lot like nouns, since they often fulfil similar grammatical relations
* relative clauses
    * behave like adjectives, usually modifiers of a noun phrase
    * sometimes can be rendered as phrases given certain manipulations

Characteristics of Subordinate Clauses
* can differ a lot from language to language
* the tighter the dependence between main and subordinate clause,  the less likely you will find intonation breaks
* typically morphologically marked by some kind of subordinating particle or affix
    * the subordinator may carry lexical content (contribute to meaning of the clause) or not, e.g. “I eat beats because they are in season” vs “I hope that I can go"
* sometimes the subordinator can be omitted if it does not carry meaning (“I hope I can go”)
* subordinate structures regularly use a non-finite form of the verb
* languages also produce subordinate structures through nominalisation 
    * in this case, the verb is transformed into a nominal through derivational morphology
* often subordinate clauses use fewer constituents or different word order (german)
* often the discourse function of a subordinate construction is one of backgrounding, explanation, or description.

Adverbial Clauses
* many languages do not use this at all, or very rarely
* hard to classify since they have a breadth of meanings
* Some uses:
    * time
        * provide information about the relative temporal ordering of events
        * often choice of tense in construction is bound in some way by the tense of the main verb (think primary/secondary sequence in greek)
        * not necessarily typical, although english has lots
    * Location
        * rare for a language to have a robust set of location subordinators, and instead PPs or relative clauses are used.
        * e.g. “The police were digging where Jeffrey had planted a garden."
    * Cause
        * often useful to indicate cause or motive behind event (“Because x, John did y…. to say z”)
        * some languages signal difference between enablement and purpose through the mood chosen
    * Conditional
        * “If you can’t beat them, join them!"
        * real conditions = those that could potentially be fulfilled
            * may be general truths, present situations, or past situations
        * Unreal conditions = those that cannot be fulfilled
            * may be hypotheticals or counterfactuals
        * protasis = “if clause"
        * apodosis = “then clause"
        * the relative types in english (and most languages) are indicated by choices of tense/aspect/mood in protasis and apodosis
    * concessive
        * “Even though x, y"
        * all languages seem to have some way to indicate contrast between propositions, although not all do so through subordinating structures
        * in those that do use a subordinate structure, use of the subordinating particle appears to be the dominant way to do so
    * unspecified relationship
        * “Having done y, he did x"
        * sometimes the logical connection between two clauses can be left unspecified and the reader/listener allowed to draw their own conclusions.

Complement Clause
* a clause that is an argument of a predicate, typically as a subject or direct object
* “When you leave makes no difference to me” vs “I cannot believe that you ate the whole thing"
* The clause within which the complement is embedding is called the matrix clause
* complement clauses do not always occur as full clauses but instead may arise as phrases headed by non-finite verb forms such as infinites and participles
* we can have multiple embedding of complements too: “I want [to believe [that you are right]]"
* two main ways to signal dependency:
    * complementiser (subordination particle)
        * if language is VO, appears at beginning of clause, usually
        * if language is OV, appears both complement initial and final
        * uncommon, but has been found in middle of complement
    * use of non-finite verb form
    * complement type choice has been argued to reflect the semantic relationship of the complement to the matrix clause verb
        * uses semantic criteria to rate verbs: high control -> low control
            * from high to low: causation, attempt, knowledge, belief, report
        * if a point along the scale on the lower end is related to a certain syntactic structure, anything on the left (with higher control) will not be associated with a less integrated structure
        * e.g. if a language uses infinitive to encode the complements of belief verbs, you would not expect causation verbs to use finite verbs with complements
        * however, this tendency is violated by languages, including english. As such it is nothing more than a general tendency
        * there is empirical support, though, and there is various literature examining this further!

Relative Clauses
* also called adjective clauses
* typically found as modifiers of a noun
* entity being modified by noun = head noun or relativised noun
* if relative clauses are introduced by a special word, they are called relativises or relative pronouns (if the pronoun specifies some nominal properties)
* restrictive vs non-restrictive relative clauses
    * restrictive = restricts noun to be a certain thing (e.g. “My bro who lives next to me called yesterday” - you are specifying one bro out of many)
    * non-restrictive = purely descriptive (e.g. “My bro, who lives next to me, called yesterday!” - you are just describing the bro)
* relativisation strategies
    * presence of relativisor is not necessary! Japanese just used word order.
    * VO languages use noun + relative clause order
    * OV languages use both orders with a weak preference for noun + relative clause ordering
    * don’t even need head noun of a relative clause (as in greek - for indefinite constructions)
    * relativised noun if often just ‘gapped’ - there is a gap where the noun would have been
        * another option is to indicate the noun by including a personal pronoun in the relative clause
        * both strategies can be used by one languages
    * what nominals are allowed to be relativised can change
        * english allows a lot of constituents to be relativised
        * many languages only allow relativisation of a subset of these, e.g. just subject
        * We get the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy from this:
            * subject > direct object > oblique > possessor
            * some exceptions do apply if more than one strategy is used for relativisation (as in certain strategies lie at different places in the hierarchy)
            * we have to make two changes to the hierarchy:
                * the subject is always relativizable
                * a given relativisation strategy will cover a contiguous portion of the hierarchy
* Preposition stranding
    * in english, if relativisation of a noun occurs, the preposition associated with it may appear in its conventional position within the adjective clause, or before the relative pronoun (if the latter, this is called pipe-piping)
        * the first option is unusual among languages
* some languages have constructions similar but not identical to relativisation
    * for example, participle phrase usage
    * in general, if a language tends toward using nonfinite verbs for other embedded structures (such as adverbials and complements), then there is sufficient grounds to consider such constructions relative clauses
    * if there is abundant usage of finite clauses in embedded structures, participle modifiers are best treated independent of relative clauses
        * e.g. “going into the store” would not be considered a type of relative clause in english!
